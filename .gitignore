# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Defaults file types
*.pyc

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp

# Project excludes
.dev
app-engine/.coverage
app-engine/.python-version
app-engine/nose.cfg
app-engine/lib
app-engine/config/secrets.py
